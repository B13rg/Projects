# Projects

This is a repository to hold all the various projects I do.  Instead of giving each one a repository, I put the different projects I do in here.  It makes it easier to start projects and easier to share!

In no particular order...

## BBC Effects Library Website
### Description
This is a Django project meant to make downloading sound clips from the BBC Sound Effect archive much easier.  There are around 16,000 or 303(ish)GB of sound files, randing from engine noises to audience sounds at a concert.  The current site located at: [http://bbcsfx.acropolis.org.uk/](http://bbcsfx.acropolis.org.uk/) and only features a simple search function which isn't that useful.
### Goals
* Create a simple two page website: home and search results
* Allow searching through Titles, Categories, and CD names
* Allow user to select multiple files and download them all at once

## Reddit Bots
### Description
This project contains various examples of Reddit bots.  Using these you can easily figure out how to build one for a specific purpose.
## URL Checker
### Description
This will be a script that will comb through a list of URL's and compile information about them.  Currently, it only (kind of) checks if it is online.
### Goals
* Grab more information about websites
  * Whois data
  * Protocol versions
  * Screenshot or PDF of the website in question
## Youtube Watched Autoremover
### Description
The purpose of this tool is to remove videos from a youtube "Watch Later" playlist.  Videos can be added very easily, but once they are watched they remain in the list until you remove them.  This would automaticlly run every X minutes or hours and clear out the playlist of watched videos.  That way, the list won't contain videos you've already seen.
### Goals
* Work.
* Choose wether to delete videos or add them to another playlist
